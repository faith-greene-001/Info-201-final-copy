##### Abstract:  
Our main question is how the availability of trans healthcare regarding medically transitioning impacts the rates of trans suicide and transphobic hate crimes. This question is essential because data about trans people are often unknown to the general populous, so helping to increase the wealth of data available will help continue the fight for trans rights. To address this concern, we plan to look at available data sets and analyze if the rates of suicide and hate crimes change before and after, in a place, and with or without the availability of transition healthcare.
