##### Abstract  
Our main question is how the availability of trans healthcare regarding medically transitioning impacts the rates of trans suicide and transphobic hate crimes. This question is essential because data about trans people are often unknown to the general populous, so helping to increase the wealth of data available will help continue the fight for trans rights. To address this concern, we plan to look at available data sets and analyze if the rates of suicide and hate crimes change before and after, in a place, and with or without the availability of transition healthcare.    

##### Keywords
- Trans Rights
- Trans Suicide
- Medical Transitioning Impacts
- Trans Hate Crimes


##### 1.0 Introduction
The main goal of our project is to analyze data on the relationship between the impacts of transphobic hate crimes and the rate of trans population suicides. We’re also looking into the availability of trans healthcare regarding medical transitioning. With this project, we hope to shed light on the struggles placed upon trans people because this is a topic that often gets overlooked. We also hope to show the effects of limited availability to transition healthcare on trans suicides. We’re using the data sets to show the increasing number of suicides with trans hate crimes.


##### 2.0 Design Situation: You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (about 400 words)

###### - _Framing the topic of concern:_
The topic of concern is the effect of the availability of trans healthcare on the trans population concerning trans suicides. A key element would be trans rights. Trans rights are solely a social justice that hinders trans peoples' ability to transition fully.

###### - _Human Values:_
The principal human value we're emphasizing with our chosen topic is equal rights and accepting people for who they are. These values come from providing trans people with the medical tools to transition to being who they are. We chose this topic to draw attention to the issues surrounding trans rights and emphasize the detrimental results of these hate crimes. A considerable tension from this could be those who don’t believe in providing the trans populous access to medical care because of their ignorance.

###### - _Stakeholders:_
The direct stakeholders of our topic are the general population. We're motivated to raise awareness on injustices towards trans people, resulting in increasing numbers of suicides. We're also bringing to light the problems surrounding the lack of availability of trans healthcare. Indirect stakeholders could be policymakers who can make a difference in making trans healthcare accessible for everyone. Other stakeholders include those within the medical field. By displaying all this information, it may encourage some advocates within the specific work field to open up the possibilities of change.

###### - _Benefits & Harms:_
A potential benefit would be a change surrounding the availability of trans healthcare. If this information were to incite any positive outcome, this would be by far the greatest. It would mean that the data we presented provoked some feelings of action and realization that something must change. Some unanticipated consequences could be that our presentation of data doesn't motivate the effort that we hoped would happen. In other words, there continues to be no advocation towards equality for trans people.

##### 3.0 Research questions

###### ***Q.1***
How does limited access to medical care for the trans population affect their transitioning process and mental health?
###### ***Q.2***
What is the result of many trans hate crimes on suicide rates among trans people?
###### ***Q.3***
What opinions and perspectives on equal medical access rights for the transgender populous can we infer based on the number of successful transition stories?
###### ***Q.4***
What effect will this data on suicide rates, trans hate crimes, and lack of medical accessibility for transitioning have on society’s response to these issues?

##### 4.0 The Dataset | See Design Brief, setions B.5 (_Size and complexity_) and B.6 (_Data provenance_) (about 400 words)
(describe size/complexity: Number of Rows/Records, Number of Attributes/Features,Origins of Data)


- Who/what is represented in the data
- what is an observation? What variables are included/excluded
- Who collected the data? When? For what purpose? How was the data collection effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money?  
- How was the data validated and held secure? Is it credible/trustworthy?
- How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data?

##### 5.0 Expected Implications
A significant implication from our research questions for policymakers would be that something needs to change. The trans population deserves equal care and medical access towards their transitioning process. There would also be profound implications towards those who believe the hate crimes inflicted upon trans are justified. It would show that their words and actions have detrimental effects on fellow human beings. We would expect our dataset to have the most significant impact on policymakers. They would be the ones to listen to what needs to change, and they’re the only ones with the power to do so legally.

##### 6.0 Limitations
A considerable limitation we face with this topic is a limited pool of information on our choice. We want to make sure we deliver an adequate and effective amount of data to get the outcome we're anticipating. If we don't provide it in a way that's easy for everyone to understand the message we're portraying, we would have failed in the goal we're attempting to meet in raising attention on the injustices towards transgender people.

We would like to thank our fellow peers for helping us find some data sets.
