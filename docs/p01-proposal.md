##### Abstract  
Our main question is how the availability of trans healthcare regarding medically transitioning impacts the rates of trans suicide and transphobic hate crimes. This question is essential because data about trans people are often unknown to the general populous, so helping to increase the wealth of data available will help continue the fight for trans rights. To address this concern, we plan to look at available data sets and analyze if the rates of suicide and hate crimes change before and after, in a place, and with or without the availability of transition healthcare.    

##### Keywords
- Trans Rights
- Trans Suicide
- Medical Transitioning Impacts
- Trans Hate Crimes


##### 1.0 Introduction
Our project takes on Trans rights and their overall livelihood in the United States. The trans community has been subject to oppression both on social media and in real life. We as a group have decided to shed light on issues specifically in the trans community that is affected by outside factors. Some of these factors include hate crimes and lack of medical resources or support related to the patient's choice of transitioning. We are connecting and comparing these outside factors mentioned to the rate of suicide in the trans community. Our data set will consist of hate crime(against trans) count in various months; also, a second data source will contain the number of self-harm within the community each month. We will make sure to update our data as our questions become specific, and as such, we can retrieve our answers from each data source.


##### 2.0 Design Situation: You may find it helpful to include a figure.

###### - _Framing the topic of concern:_
The topic of concern is the effect of the availability of trans healthcare on the trans population concerning trans suicides. A key element would be trans rights. Trans rights are solely a social justice that hinders trans peoples' ability to transition fully.

###### - _Human Values:_
The principal human value we're emphasizing with our chosen topic is equal rights and accepting people for who they are. These values come from providing trans people with the medical tools to transition to being who they are. We chose this topic to draw attention to the issues surrounding trans rights and emphasize the detrimental results of these hate crimes. A considerable tension from this could be those who don’t believe in providing the trans populous access to medical care because of their ignorance.

###### - _Stakeholders:_
The direct stakeholders of our topic are the general population. We're motivated to raise awareness on injustices towards trans people, resulting in increasing numbers of suicides. We're also bringing to light the problems surrounding the lack of availability of trans healthcare. Indirect stakeholders could be policymakers who can make a difference in making trans healthcare accessible for everyone. Other stakeholders include those within the medical field. By displaying all this information, it may encourage some advocates within the specific work field to open up the possibilities of change.

###### - _Benefits & Harms:_
A potential benefit would be a change surrounding the availability of trans healthcare. If this information were to incite any positive outcome, this would be by far the greatest. It would mean that the data we presented provoked some feelings of action and realization that something must change. Some unanticipated consequences could be that our presentation of data doesn't motivate the effort that we hoped would happen. In other words, there continues to be no advocation towards equality for trans people.

##### 3.0 Research questions

###### ***Q.1***
How does limited access to medical care for the trans population affect their transitioning process and mental health?
###### ***Q.2***
What is the result of many trans hate crimes on suicide rates among trans people?
###### ***Q.3***
What opinions and perspectives on equal medical access rights for the transgender populous can we infer based on the number of successful transition stories?
###### ***Q.4***
What effect will this data on suicide rates, trans hate crimes, and lack of medical accessibility for transitioning have on society’s response to these issues?

##### 4.0 The Dataset | See Design Brief, setions B.5 (_Size and complexity_) and B.6 (_Data provenance_) (about 400 words)
(describe size/complexity: Number of Rows/Records, Number of Attributes/Features,Origins of Data)
As of writing, we have 3 data sets, though we may add more if we find relevant datasets that make up for limitations. While we do have a later section on limitations as part of my analysis of the three datasets, I will mention the limitations of each.
Our first dataset comes courtesy of the Trans Day of Remembrance organization that consolidated data from the Trans Murder Monitoring Project and Transgender Europe. Of all the datasets, this is one I, Faith, trust the most, as it was collected with the purpose of furthering transgender rights all over the world. Now the data itself has 4034 entries, with 21 data points per entry, though most probably won't be of use for this project, but are still haunting, with 3 data points being different links to a more detailed site about each victim. But it would be remiss of me to not mention the limitations, namely that the data is all ***reported*** deaths, we don't know how many who died were just not reported or the reports lost, not to mention that those who die in the closet won't be reported in such a way to make it onto the dataset, thus our data is incomplete.
Our second dataset comes courtesy of the FBI and it records hate crimes since 1991, has 28 data points and 1,318,023 entries, most of this data won't be relevant, as we care only about anti-trans hate crime, but the dataset does record the type of hate crime.... but only after 2014, so we will be missing a lot of hate crimes for the times where I, Faith, would expect them to be in their heyday in the US. Now because this is the FBI reporting, many hate crimes committed by police are probably not reported. However, on the whole, I expect what is reported to be true.
The last dataset is compiled by Faith Greene (me) from https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/healthcare_laws_and_policies using the Wayback Machine at https://web.archive.org/ to approximate dates, and it of all 50 states, DC, and most of the territories laws on healthcare for trans individuals. Pinning down dates before may 5th 2015 would take more time than I have to spend on this project, because the Wayback machine does not have captures of my source from before that date, meaning I'd have to dig into states' legislative histories. Now I had to take this imprecise method because there aren't really datasets on the history of this subject, as most people care about the now in this scenario, and rightfully so. But this means my data is really untrustworthy because I spent over 8 hours compiling it by noting differences in the non-CSV table the site uses and recording when each change occurred, so exact dates are wrong by at bests a few days, but if I missed something big, it could be months. Also, I didn't record everything I could, only recording whether there were private insurance anti-discrimination laws, laws for or against the exclusion of trans-specific care for private insurance, and whether Medicaid provided trans-specific care. I did not monitor whether state employees had trans benefits to ease the burden on myself, I also have not accounted for how many people have access to insurance nor how many doctors in a particular area are available. Were I to have more than a few days to spend on this, and more people to help, the data would be a lot better, but for now, it will have to do.

##### 5.0 Expected Implications
A significant implication from our research questions for policymakers would be that something needs to change. The trans population deserves equal care and medical access towards their transitioning process. There would also be profound implications towards those who believe the hate crimes inflicted upon trans are justified. It would show that their words and actions have detrimental effects on fellow human beings. We would expect our dataset to have the most significant impact on policymakers. They would be the ones to listen to what needs to change, and they’re the only ones with the power to do so legally.

##### 6.0 Limitations
A considerable limitation we face with this topic is a limited pool of information on our choice. We want to make sure we deliver an adequate and effective amount of data to get the outcome we're anticipating. If we don't provide the data in a way that's easy for everyone to understand the message we're portraying, we would have failed in the goal we're attempting to meet in raising attention on the injustices towards transgender people. We’re limited in the types of data sets, not just the amount of data. We want to find ones that can show the relationship between trans hate crimes and the lack of social and medical support for the transgender community.
