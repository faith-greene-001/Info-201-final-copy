##### Abstract:  
Our main question is how the availability of trans healthcare regarding medically transitioning impacts the rates of trans suicide and transphobic hate crimes. This question is essential because data about trans people are often unknown to the general populous, so helping to increase the wealth of data available will help continue the fight for trans rights. To address this concern, we plan to look at available data sets and analyze if the rates of suicide and hate crimes change before and after, in a place, and with or without the availability of transition healthcare.    

##### Keywords
- Trans Rights
- Trans Suicide
- Medical Transitioning Impacts
- Trans Hate Crimes


##### 1.0 Introduction  (about 150 words)
The main goal of our project is to analyze data on relationship between the impacts of transphobic hate crimes and rate of trans population suicides. Weâ€™re also looking into the availability of trans healthcare in regards of medical transitioning. With this project, we hope to shed light on the struggles placed upon trans people because this is a topic that often gets overlooked. We also hope to show the affects of limited availability to transition healthcare on trans suicides.


##### 2.0 Design Situation: You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (about 400 words)

###### - _Framing the topic of concern:_
The topic of concern is the effect of the availability of trans healthcare on the trans population concerning trans suicides. A key element would be trans rights. Trans rights are solely a social justice that hinders trans peoples' ability to transition fully.

###### - _Human Values:_
The principal human value we're emphasizing with our chosen topic is equal rights and accepting people for who they are. These values come from providing trans people with the medical tools to transition to being who they are. We chose this topic to draw attention to the issues surrounding trans rights and emphasize the detrimental results of these hate crimes.

###### - _Stakeholders:_
The direct stakeholders of our topic are the general population. We're motivated to raise awareness on injustices towards trans people, resulting in suicides. We're also bringing to light the problems surrounding the lack of availability of trans healthcare. Indirect stakeholders could be policymakers who can make a difference in making trans healthcare accessible for everyone. Other stakeholders include those within the medical field. By displaying all this information, it may incite some advocates within the specific work field to open up the possibilities of change.

###### - _Benefits & Harms:_
A potential benefit would be a change surrounding availability of trans healthcare. If this information were to incite any positive outcome, this would be by far the greatest. It would mean that the data we presented incited some feelings of action and realization that something must be done.
