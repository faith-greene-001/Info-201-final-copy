# The `\data` Directory: Project Data Summary

In our project, we use the following data files and Application Programming Interfaces:

### Data files (TODO: Update/delete)

# NOTE 1: About the `/data` Directory

* Use the `/data` directory to store any data that you using in your project (for example, CSV files)
* Edit this `README.md` file and summarize your data files
* If you are using APIs to access data, summarize them, providing specific information
* See examples above.

# NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore,
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
