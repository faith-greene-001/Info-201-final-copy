The murderer, identified as Davinson Erazo, was taken by the police. It seems that he has 
mental issues; about the causes, they think that the person incited minors to suicide and 
that the aggressor had done the crime, tired of the suspected requirements of the victim 
for him to commit suicide and more minor child did the same.
