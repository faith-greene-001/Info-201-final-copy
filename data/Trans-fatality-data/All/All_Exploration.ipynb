She was shot by the Los Angeles Police Department for \"walking while trans\".\\n\\n&gt; In March 1970, an article appeared in the Los Angeles Times about the increase in Gay marches and protests and another suspicious homicide. On March 7, two days before the anniversary of Howard Efland’s murder, LAPD gunned down Larry “Laverne” Turner, who the Times describes as ‘a twenty year old black male transvestite dressed in female clothing, who was shot once while being arrested for prostitution outdoors near 56th Street and Broadway.’ The police claimed it was in self-defense.\\n\\n&gt; A Los Angeles Police Department plainclothes officer, Carlton Olson, picked up a female prostitute. Olson then joined other officers and ordered Turner out of the car. According to the L.A.P.D., Turner proclaimed, “Oh God, I can’t go to jail!” and shot at officers with a .22 caliber pistol concealed at [her] waist. One officer returned fire, hitting Turner in the chest.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Witnesses tell another story. They saw Turner, who they identified as a woman, running away from police, not returning fire. Witnesses even reported that Turner was handcuffed by police after [she] was shot.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; According to an article by Angela Douglas in Come Out! Magazine shortly after their deaths, Laverne (Larry) Turner and Ginny Gallegos were both killed for resisting arrest and in Laverne’s case for being dressed in “feminine attire.”\\n\\nLaverne had been in service with the U.S. Navy but had been discharged because she had an antipathy towards weapons.\\n\\nhttp://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/the-politics-of-gender-self-determination-more-interviews-with-captive-genders-contributors/\\n\\nhttp://erikasuderburg.com/id28.html\\n\\nhttps://www.lib.umn.edu/pdf/tretter/TretterLetterJune2011.pdf\\n\\nhttp://students673.ucr.edu/docsserver/lgbt/trans_remembrance_display_posters.pdf\\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_JeZ7LEIRhvewTCoL5mVkH6MQJzf7fSXl4-P6QJ0v0/edit#gid=0</td>\n",

       "      <td>Maxwell/Michelle was burned alive. Three teenagers were convicted of the crime, but freed on appeal.\\n\\n&gt; Maxwell was found dead in his house on Doggett Road on April 22nd 1972. He was 26-years old, of dual heritage and gay. He often crossed-dressed and was also known as Michelle.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Maxwell was often seen drinking in The Black Bull and The Castle pubs in Lewisham.\\n\\nThe investigation into the murder led to a major review into how suspects are treated by the police, especially children and vulnerable people. A cause celebre, it came to be seen as a classic miscarriage of justice.\\n\\n&gt; The Fire Brigade was called to 27 Doggett Road, Catford at 0121 hours on 22 April 1972. A body was found.  It was that of Maxwell Confait a 26 year old mixed race man from the Seychelles. A gay (?) transgender (?) prostitute, Confait preferred to be called Michelle and was well-known in the local area. He frequented the Black Bull Pub (now Fox and Firkin) and the Castle (now Bar Nuvo). He had been strangled. \\n&gt; \\n&gt; The police did not look very far. The first suspect was Winston Goode, the victim’s landlord and friend who lived at the same property with his wife Lillian and their children although the couple were separated. He denied any sexual relationship with Confait but admitted being jealous that Confait was planning to move out. Shortly afterwards he committed suicide by swallowing cyanide.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; On 24 April there were three more fires: along the railway line near Catford Bridge Station; a sports hut on Ladywell Fields and 1 Nelgarde Road (the next street).The police arrested three youths. Colin Lattimore aged eighteen but with learning disabilities, Ronnie Leighton, aged 15 and Ahmet Salih aged 14. The three were questioned without another adult present. Lattimore admitted to the murder but Salih confessed only to observing it.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; The case went to trial at the Old Bailey where it received national media coverage. Despite the boys all having alibis for the time of death and claiming that the police had been violent to them in custody, Lattimore was found guilty of manslaughter, detained indefinitely, and sent to Rampton Hospital.\\nLeighton and Salih were found guilty of arson at Doggett Road and Ladywell Fields. Leighton was sent to Aylesbury Prison for life. Salih was sent to Royal Philanthropic School, Redhill for four years due to his age.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; In July 1973, leave to appeal was refused despite disagreement between experts over the time of death. In 1975, the Home Secretary Roy Jenkins referred the case to the Court of Appeal. Following a high-level campaign led by Christopher Price, then local MP for Lewisham East, all three suspects were later found not guilty and freed by the Appeal Court. Lord Scarman criticised the original investigation for not emphasising the fact that there had been no struggle. This suggested that the victim knew his killer. He declared all three “innocent”. The Home Secretary then ordered a full enquiry by Sir Henry Fisher to look at the Judges Rules (i.e. how the police treat suspects, especially children and vulnerable people. Fisher made recommendations for reform but disagreed with Scarman finding two of the three defendants ” guilty on the balance of probability”.  As a result, the report had to be published as a “return to the House of Commons” to make it exempt from libel. A Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure followed.\\n\\n&gt; In 1972, a man called Maxwell Confait was murdered. Two children and a man with an intellectual disability were arrested and, based on their confessions, convicted. Several years later, forensic evidence showed that they were innocent. Their confessions had been false and were the combined result of their vulnerability and their treatment by police during detention and questioning.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Public concern over the Maxwell Confait case in 1972 led Parliament, via a public inquiry and then a Royal Commission, to pass the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and its Codes of Practice (PACE).  \\n&gt; \\n&gt; PACE set out the rules and safeguards for policing in England and Wales including role of the appropriate adult (AA). The principal intention was to reduce the risk of miscarriages of justice as a result of evidence being obtained from vulnerable suspects which, by virtue of their vulnerability, led to unsafe and unjust convictions\\n\\nMaxwell/Michelle Confit’s murder remains unsolved.\\n\\nRadical Deviance, May 1997\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Maxwell_Confait\\n\\nhttp://gaynewsarchive.org/tag/maxwell-confait/\\n\\nhttps://lewishamheritage.blogspot.com/2018/08/the-maxwell-confait-murder.html\\n\\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1095508.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\\n\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-an-inquiry-into-the-death-of-maxwell-confait\\n\\nhttps://www.appropriateadult.org.uk/index.php/information/development/need/fair-justice/history\\n\\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190219220503/https://www.catfordcentral.com/do-you-remember-maxwell-confait-michelle/\\n\\nhttp://students673.ucr.edu/docsserver/lgbt/trans_remembrance_display_posters.pdf\\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_JeZ7LEIRhvewTCoL5mVkH6MQJzf7fSXl4-P6QJ0v0/edit#gid=0</td>\n",

She was 25 years old when she was shot on Christmas and found Christmas Night.\\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; From Chicago media (note – misgendering in original report): [She] was found about 8:35 p.m. lying unresponsive after being shot on the side of the street in the 900 block of East 82nd Street, Chicago police said. [S]he was pronounced dead on the scene. The Cook County medical examiner’s office hasn’t identified the [victim], but conducted an autopsy and ruled [the] death a homicide by gunshot wound to the head.\\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; Eshay Key, 25, was shot &amp; killed in the 900 block of East 82nd, Chatham neighborhood, Southeast Side on December 25, 2020. Her death was reported across Facebook as her loved ones learned the news. A vigil was organized Sunday, December 27, near the location where she died.\\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; Eshay was the 43rd known victim of this epidemic of transphobic violence engulfing the nation. She is the 28th Black trans person and the 24th Black trans woman murdered in the US that we know of in 2020. She is one of 18 victims age 25 or younger.\\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; Her social media feeds are filled with the exuberance and lively content you expect from a twentysomething young woman. Now they are filled with the grief of her friends. One of her last posts was a shout-out to her friend Bella, another Black trans woman who had died under mysterious circumstances in August 2020.\\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; Rest in power, Eshay.

She was shot by the Los Angeles Police Department for \"walking while trans\".\\n\\n> In March 1970, an article appeared in the Los Angeles Times about the increase in Gay marches and protests and another suspicious homicide. On March 7, two days before the anniversary of Howard Efland’s murder, LAPD gunned down Larry “Laverne” Turner, who the Times describes as ‘a twenty year old black male transvestite dressed in female clothing, who was shot once while being arrested for prostitution outdoors near 56th Street and Broadway.’ The police claimed it was in self-defense.\\n\\n> A Los Angeles Police Department plainclothes officer, Carlton Olson, picked up a female prostitute. Olson then joined other officers and ordered Turner out of the car. According to the L.A.P.D., Turner proclaimed, “Oh God, I can’t go to jail!” and shot at officers with a .22 caliber pistol concealed at [her] waist. One officer returned fire, hitting Turner in the chest.\\n> \\n> Witnesses tell another story. They saw Turner, who they identified as a woman, running away from police, not returning fire. Witnesses even reported that Turner was handcuffed by police after [she] was shot.\\n> \\n> According to an article by Angela Douglas in Come Out! Magazine shortly after their deaths, Laverne (Larry) Turner and Ginny Gallegos were both killed for resisting arrest and in Laverne’s case for being dressed in “feminine attire.”\\n\\nLaverne had been in service with the U.S. Navy but had been discharged because she had an antipathy towards weapons.\\n\\nhttp://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/the-politics-of-gender-self-determination-more-interviews-with-captive-genders-contributors/\\n\\nhttp://erikasuderburg.com/id28.html\\n\\nhttps://www.lib.umn.edu/pdf/tretter/TretterLetterJune2011.pdf\\n\\nhttp://students673.ucr.edu/docsserver/lgbt/trans_remembrance_display_posters.pdf\\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_JeZ7LEIRhvewTCoL5mVkH6MQJzf7fSXl4-P6QJ0v0/edit#gid=0   \n",

Three teenagers were convicted of the crime, but freed on appeal.\\n\\n> Maxwell was found dead in his house on Doggett Road on April 22nd 1972. He was 26-years old, of dual heritage and gay. He often crossed-dressed and was also known as Michelle.\\n> \\n> Maxwell was often seen drinking in The Black Bull and The Castle pubs in Lewisham.\\n\\nThe investigation into the murder led to a major review into how suspects are treated by the police, especially children and vulnerable people. A cause celebre, it came to be seen as a classic miscarriage of justice.\\n\\n> The Fire Brigade was called to 27 Doggett Road, Catford at 0121 hours on 22 April 1972. A body was found.  It was that of Maxwell Confait a 26 year old mixed race man from the Seychelles. A gay (?) transgender (?) prostitute, Confait preferred to be called Michelle and was well-known in the local area. He frequented the Black Bull Pub (now Fox and Firkin) and the Castle (now Bar Nuvo). He had been strangled. \\n> \\n> The police did not look very far. The first suspect was Winston Goode, the victim’s landlord and friend who lived at the same property with his wife Lillian and their children although the couple were separated. He denied any sexual relationship with Confait but admitted being jealous that Confait was planning to move out. Shortly afterwards he committed suicide by swallowing cyanide.\\n> \\n> On 24 April there were three more fires: along the railway line near Catford Bridge Station; a sports hut on Ladywell Fields and 1 Nelgarde Road (the next street).The police arrested three youths. Colin Lattimore aged eighteen but with learning disabilities, Ronnie Leighton, aged 15 and Ahmet Salih aged 14. The three were questioned without another adult present. Lattimore admitted to the murder but Salih confessed only to observing it.\\n> \\n> The case went to trial at the Old Bailey where it received national media coverage. Despite the boys all having alibis for the time of death and claiming that the police had been violent to them in custody, Lattimore was found guilty of manslaughter, detained indefinitely, and sent to Rampton Hospital.\\nLeighton and Salih were found guilty of arson at Doggett Road and Ladywell Fields. Leighton was sent to Aylesbury Prison for life. Salih was sent to Royal Philanthropic School, Redhill for four years due to his age.\\n> \\n> In July 1973, leave to appeal was refused despite disagreement between experts over the time of death. In 1975, the Home Secretary Roy Jenkins referred the case to the Court of Appeal. Following a high-level campaign led by Christopher Price, then local MP for Lewisham East, all three suspects were later found not guilty and freed by the Appeal Court. Lord Scarman criticised the original investigation for not emphasising the fact that there had been no struggle. This suggested that the victim knew his killer. He declared all three “innocent”. The Home Secretary then ordered a full enquiry by Sir Henry Fisher to look at the Judges Rules (i.e. how the police treat suspects, especially children and vulnerable people. Fisher made recommendations for reform but disagreed with Scarman finding two of the three defendants ” guilty on the balance of probability”.  As a result, the report had to be published as a “return to the House of Commons” to make it exempt from libel. A Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure followed.\\n\\n> In 1972, a man called Maxwell Confait was murdered. Two children and a man with an intellectual disability were arrested and, based on their confessions, convicted. Several years later, forensic evidence showed that they were innocent. Their confessions had been false and were the combined result of their vulnerability and their treatment by police during detention and questioning.\\n> \\n> Public concern over the Maxwell Confait case in 1972 led Parliament, via a public inquiry and then a Royal Commission, to pass the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and its Codes of Practice (PACE).  \\n> \\n> PACE set out the rules and safeguards for policing in England and Wales including role of the appropriate adult (AA). The principal intention was to reduce the risk of miscarriages of justice as a result of evidence being obtained from vulnerable suspects which, by virtue of their vulnerability, led to unsafe and unjust convictions\\n\\nMaxwell/Michelle Confit’s murder remains unsolved.\\n\\nRadical Deviance, May 1997\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Maxwell_Confait\\n\\nhttp://gaynewsarchive.org/tag/maxwell-confait/\\n\\nhttps://lewishamheritage.blogspot.com/2018/08/the-maxwell-confait-murder.html\\n\\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1095508.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\\n\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-an-inquiry-into-the-death-of-maxwell-confait\\n\\nhttps://www.appropriateadult.org.uk/index.php/information/development/need/fair-justice/history\\n\\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190219220503/https://www.catfordcentral.com/do-you-remember-maxwell-confait-michelle/\\n\\nhttp://students673.ucr.edu/docsserver/lgbt/trans_remembrance_display_posters.pdf\\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_JeZ7LEIRhvewTCoL5mVkH6MQJzf7fSXl4-P6QJ0v0/edit#gid=0   \n",

       "4028  Alejandra was a professional makeup artist. Her body was found in a hotel gagged and with stab wounds after she had arranged to meet a man there. He is being sought by police.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Puebla.- A virus for which there seems to be no vaccine in Puebla is that of homophobia, which has later claimed one more victim, Alejandra Zaya, a transsexual woman who was found lifeless and with signs of having been stabbed in a hotel in the middle of Historic Center of Angelopolis. \\r\\n> \\r\\n> According to reports, Zayas was a professional makeup artist who worked mainly in Mexico City, although she was originally from Misantla, in Veracruz, but who was in the capital of Puebla to have a meeting with a man she met on a social network. \\r\\n> \\r\\n>  The Puebla State Prosecutor's Office has begun an investigation into the murder of which the main suspect is a man whose whereabouts are unknown for now, but who was identified by a relative of the victim. \\r\\n> \\r\\n> According to accounts, Zayas was found by her cousin in the Hotel Isabel on Calle 5 poniente in a pool of blood as a result of several stab wounds which she had received to the abdomen from a broken glass. \\r\\n\\r\\nAle lived in Mexico City, where she worked for MAC Cosmetics. She was originally from Misantla, in the state of Veracruz. Her Facebook profile is https://www.facebook.com/alejandroo.zl.\\r\\n\\r\\n> \"I have never liked to victimize myself, but suffering homophobia is the worst thing that can happen to someone as a person; but just those details make you stronger. Do not let it\"  -- Ale Zayas, 17th May 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\n[**#JusticiaParaAleZayas**](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/justiciaparaalezayas)

She had been stabbed in the abdomen and had been dead around 48 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victim was of Colombian origin. Her identity was not made public.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Early yesterday morning yesterday the authorities were notified about the discovery of a body next to a shopping center located in Costa del Silencio, within the municipality of Arona. Everything indicates that the death occurred at least two days before.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> The scene that the specialists of the Civil Guard displaced in the vicinity of said shopping center, called El Chaparral, had to witness, was not pleasant for anyone.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> On the ground was the lifeless body of a transsexual woman whose identity has only transcended that information, but nothing about her parentage or origin. Not only had at least 48 hours passed since the death had occurred, but the cause of death was obvious, although the last word in this regard always depends on the final results of the tests that make up an autopsy.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> The corpse had wounds in the abdominal area compatible with an attack carried out with a knife. The number of possible stab wounds will be one of the unknowns revealed by forensic specialists from the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Institute of Legal Medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nA suspect was arrested several hours after the discovery of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2020/12/arrestado-en-arona-tras-la-violenta-muerte-de-una-mujer/\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://andaluciainformacion.es/andalucia/940799/detenido-por-la-muerte-de-un-hombre-en-arona-tenerife/\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.cuerpospoliciales.com/index.php/2020/12/27/hallan-a-un-joven-en-avanzado-estado-de-descomposicion-en-costa-del-silencio/\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.eldia.es/sucesos/2020/12/27/hallan-joven-avanzado-descomposicion-costa-26765421.html\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.laprovincia.es/sucesos/2020/12/26/hallan-cadaver-signos-violencia-tenerife-26751380.html   \n",

       "4032    Courtney was found unresponsive on the side of the street after being shot on Christmas Day. She died at the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Another violent murder of a young Black trans woman. Her name was Eshay Key. She was 25 years old when she was shot on Christmas and found Christmas Night.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> From Chicago media (note – misgendering in original report): [She] was found about 8:35 p.m. lying unresponsive after being shot on the side of the street in the 900 block of East 82nd Street, Chicago police said. [S]he was pronounced dead on the scene. The Cook County medical examiner’s office hasn’t identified the [victim], but conducted an autopsy and ruled [the] death a homicide by gunshot wound to the head.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> Eshay Key, 25, was shot & killed in the 900 block of East 82nd, Chatham neighborhood, Southeast Side on December 25, 2020. Her death was reported across Facebook as her loved ones learned the news. A vigil was organized Sunday, December 27, near the location where she died.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> Eshay was the 43rd known victim of this epidemic of transphobic violence engulfing the nation. She is the 28th Black trans person and the 24th Black trans woman murdered in the US that we know of in 2020. She is one of 18 victims age 25 or younger.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> Her social media feeds are filled with the exuberance and lively content you expect from a twentysomething young woman. Now they are filled with the grief of her friends. One of her last posts was a shout-out to her friend Bella, another Black trans woman who had died under mysterious circumstances in August 2020.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> Rest in power, Eshay. You were taken from this world far too young and clearly deeply missed by many, many people. Your life was magical and should have continued for many years. Your loved ones will seek justice for your death and lift up your life.\\r\\n\\r\\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmorganlooks%2Fposts%2F10102440541213286&width=500&show_text=true&height=542&appId\" width=\"500\" height=\"542\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\\r\\n\\r\\nEshay's Facebook profile is https://www.facebook.com/zakyiah.jones.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://planettransgender.com/chicago-trans-woman-real-eshay-murdered-christmas-day/\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.pghlesbian.com/2020/12/25-year-old-black-trans-woman-murdered-on-christmas-day-in-chicago/\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/12/25/22200208/man-found-dead-south-side-street-82nd\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-east-chatham-street-man-dead-20201226-yfdhjz4q2ndy5mruq6rhiv3taa-story.html\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TransfamilyOfNWPA/posts/3594181674004086\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lhfirm/photos/a.264035270835914/847487272490708/?type=3\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/morganlooks/posts/10102440541213286\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/morganlooks/posts/10102440541213286\n",

She was shot by the Los Angeles Police Department for \"walking while trans\".\\n\\n&gt; In March 1970, an article appeared in the Los Angeles Times about the increase in Gay marches and protests and another suspicious homicide. On March 7, two days before the anniversary of Howard Efland’s murder, LAPD gunned down Larry “Laverne” Turner, who the Times describes as ‘a twenty year old black male transvestite dressed in female clothing, who was shot once while being arrested for prostitution outdoors near 56th Street and Broadway.’ The police claimed it was in self-defense.\\n\\n&gt; A Los Angeles Police Department plainclothes officer, Carlton Olson, picked up a female prostitute. Olson then joined other officers and ordered Turner out of the car. According to the L.A.P.D., Turner proclaimed, “Oh God, I can’t go to jail!” and shot at officers with a .22 caliber pistol concealed at [her] waist. One officer returned fire, hitting Turner in the chest.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Witnesses tell another story. They saw Turner, who they identified as a woman, running away from police, not returning fire. Witnesses even reported that Turner was handcuffed by police after [she] was shot.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; According to an article by Angela Douglas in Come Out! Magazine shortly after their deaths, Laverne (Larry) Turner and Ginny Gallegos were both killed for resisting arrest and in Laverne’s case for being dressed in “feminine attire.”\\n\\nLaverne had been in service with the U.S. Navy but had been discharged because she had an antipathy towards weapons.\\n\\nhttp://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/the-politics-of-gender-self-determination-more-interviews-with-captive-genders-contributors/\\n\\nhttp://erikasuderburg.com/id28.html\\n\\nhttps://www.lib.umn.edu/pdf/tretter/TretterLetterJune2011.pdf\\n\\nhttp://students673.ucr.edu/docsserver/lgbt/trans_remembrance_display_posters.pdf\\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_JeZ7LEIRhvewTCoL5mVkH6MQJzf7fSXl4-P6QJ0v0/edit#gid=0</td>\n",

       "      <td>Maxwell/Michelle was burned alive. Three teenagers were convicted of the crime, but freed on appeal.\\n\\n&gt; Maxwell was found dead in his house on Doggett Road on April 22nd 1972. He was 26-years old, of dual heritage and gay. He often crossed-dressed and was also known as Michelle.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Maxwell was often seen drinking in The Black Bull and The Castle pubs in Lewisham.\\n\\nThe investigation into the murder led to a major review into how suspects are treated by the police, especially children and vulnerable people. A cause celebre, it came to be seen as a classic miscarriage of justice.\\n\\n&gt; The Fire Brigade was called to 27 Doggett Road, Catford at 0121 hours on 22 April 1972. A body was found.  It was that of Maxwell Confait a 26 year old mixed race man from the Seychelles. A gay (?) transgender (?) prostitute, Confait preferred to be called Michelle and was well-known in the local area. He frequented the Black Bull Pub (now Fox and Firkin) and the Castle (now Bar Nuvo). He had been strangled. \\n&gt; \\n&gt; The police did not look very far. The first suspect was Winston Goode, the victim’s landlord and friend who lived at the same property with his wife Lillian and their children although the couple were separated. He denied any sexual relationship with Confait but admitted being jealous that Confait was planning to move out. Shortly afterwards he committed suicide by swallowing cyanide.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; On 24 April there were three more fires: along the railway line near Catford Bridge Station; a sports hut on Ladywell Fields and 1 Nelgarde Road (the next street).The police arrested three youths. Colin Lattimore aged eighteen but with learning disabilities, Ronnie Leighton, aged 15 and Ahmet Salih aged 14. The three were questioned without another adult present. Lattimore admitted to the murder but Salih confessed only to observing it.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; The case went to trial at the Old Bailey where it received national media coverage. Despite the boys all having alibis for the time of death and claiming that the police had been violent to them in custody, Lattimore was found guilty of manslaughter, detained indefinitely, and sent to Rampton Hospital.\\nLeighton and Salih were found guilty of arson at Doggett Road and Ladywell Fields. Leighton was sent to Aylesbury Prison for life. Salih was sent to Royal Philanthropic School, Redhill for four years due to his age.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; In July 1973, leave to appeal was refused despite disagreement between experts over the time of death. In 1975, the Home Secretary Roy Jenkins referred the case to the Court of Appeal. Following a high-level campaign led by Christopher Price, then local MP for Lewisham East, all three suspects were later found not guilty and freed by the Appeal Court. Lord Scarman criticised the original investigation for not emphasising the fact that there had been no struggle. This suggested that the victim knew his killer. He declared all three “innocent”. The Home Secretary then ordered a full enquiry by Sir Henry Fisher to look at the Judges Rules (i.e. how the police treat suspects, especially children and vulnerable people. Fisher made recommendations for reform but disagreed with Scarman finding two of the three defendants ” guilty on the balance of probability”.  As a result, the report had to be published as a “return to the House of Commons” to make it exempt from libel. A Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure followed.\\n\\n&gt; In 1972, a man called Maxwell Confait was murdered. Two children and a man with an intellectual disability were arrested and, based on their confessions, convicted. Several years later, forensic evidence showed that they were innocent. Their confessions had been false and were the combined result of their vulnerability and their treatment by police during detention and questioning.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Public concern over the Maxwell Confait case in 1972 led Parliament, via a public inquiry and then a Royal Commission, to pass the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and its Codes of Practice (PACE).  \\n&gt; \\n&gt; PACE set out the rules and safeguards for policing in England and Wales including role of the appropriate adult (AA). The principal intention was to reduce the risk of miscarriages of justice as a result of evidence being obtained from vulnerable suspects which, by virtue of their vulnerability, led to unsafe and unjust convictions\\n\\nMaxwell/Michelle Confit’s murder remains unsolved.\\n\\nRadical Deviance, May 1997\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Maxwell_Confait\\n\\nhttp://gaynewsarchive.org/tag/maxwell-confait/\\n\\nhttps://lewishamheritage.blogspot.com/2018/08/the-maxwell-confait-murder.html\\n\\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1095508.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\\n\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-an-inquiry-into-the-death-of-maxwell-confait\\n\\nhttps://www.appropriateadult.org.uk/index.php/information/development/need/fair-justice/history\\n\\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190219220503/https://www.catfordcentral.com/do-you-remember-maxwell-confait-michelle/\\n\\nhttp://students673.ucr.edu/docsserver/lgbt/trans_remembrance_display_posters.pdf\\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_JeZ7LEIRhvewTCoL5mVkH6MQJzf7fSXl4-P6QJ0v0/edit#gid=0</td>\n",

He is being sought by police.\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; Puebla.- A virus for which there seems to be no vaccine in Puebla is that of homophobia, which has later claimed one more victim, Alejandra Zaya, a transsexual woman who was found lifeless and with signs of having been stabbed in a hotel in the middle of Historic Center of Angelopolis. \\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; According to reports, Zayas was a professional makeup artist who worked mainly in Mexico City, although she was originally from Misantla, in Veracruz, but who was in the capital of Puebla to have a meeting with a man she met on a social network. \\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt;  The Puebla State Prosecutor's Office has begun an investigation into the murder of which the main suspect is a man whose whereabouts are unknown for now, but who was identified by a relative of the victim. \\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; According to accounts, Zayas was found by her cousin in the Hotel Isabel on Calle 5 poniente in a pool of blood as a result of several stab wounds which she had received to the abdomen from a broken glass. \\r\\n\\r\\nAle lived in Mexico City, where she worked for MAC Cosmetics. She was originally from Misantla, in the state of Veracruz. Her Facebook profile is https://www.facebook.com/alejandroo.zl.\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; \"I have never liked to victimize myself, but suffering homophobia is the worst thing that can happen to someone as a person; but just those details make you stronger. Do not let it\"  -- Ale Zayas, 17th May 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\n[**#JusticiaParaAleZayas**](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/justiciaparaalezayas)

She was 25 years old when she was shot on Christmas and found Christmas Night.\\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; From Chicago media (note – misgendering in original report): [She] was found about 8:35 p.m. lying unresponsive after being shot on the side of the street in the 900 block of East 82nd Street, Chicago police said. [S]he was pronounced dead on the scene. The Cook County medical examiner’s office hasn’t identified the [victim], but conducted an autopsy and ruled [the] death a homicide by gunshot wound to the head.\\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; Eshay Key, 25, was shot &amp; killed in the 900 block of East 82nd, Chatham neighborhood, Southeast Side on December 25, 2020. Her death was reported across Facebook as her loved ones learned the news. A vigil was organized Sunday, December 27, near the location where she died.\\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; Eshay was the 43rd known victim of this epidemic of transphobic violence engulfing the nation. She is the 28th Black trans person and the 24th Black trans woman murdered in the US that we know of in 2020. She is one of 18 victims age 25 or younger.\\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; Her social media feeds are filled with the exuberance and lively content you expect from a twentysomething young woman. Now they are filled with the grief of her friends. One of her last posts was a shout-out to her friend Bella, another Black trans woman who had died under mysterious circumstances in August 2020.\\r\\n&gt; \\r\\n&gt; Rest in power, Eshay. You were taken from this world far too young and clearly deeply missed by many, many people. Your life was magical and should have continued for many years. Your loved ones will seek justice for your death and lift up your life.\\r\\n\\r\\n&lt;iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmorganlooks%2Fposts%2F10102440541213286&amp;width=500&amp;show_text=true&amp;height=542&amp;appId\" width=\"500\" height=\"542\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\nEshay's Facebook profile is https://www.facebook.com/zakyiah.jones.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://planettransgender.com/chicago-trans-woman-real-eshay-murdered-christmas-day/\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.pghlesbian.com/2020/12/25-year-old-black-trans-woman-murdered-on-christmas-day-in-chicago/\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/12/25/22200208/man-found-dead-south-side-street-82nd\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-east-chatham-street-man-dead-20201226-yfdhjz4q2ndy5mruq6rhiv3taa-story.html\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TransfamilyOfNWPA/posts/3594181674004086\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/lhfirm/photos/a.264035270835914/847487272490708/?type=3\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/morganlooks/posts/10102440541213286\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/morganlooks/posts/10102440541213286</td>\n",

She was shot by the Los Angeles Police Department for \"walking while trans\".\\n\\n> In March 1970, an article appeared in the Los Angeles Times about the increase in Gay marches and protests and another suspicious homicide. On March 7, two days before the anniversary of Howard Efland’s murder, LAPD gunned down Larry “Laverne” Turner, who the Times describes as ‘a twenty year old black male transvestite dressed in female clothing, who was shot once while being arrested for prostitution outdoors near 56th Street and Broadway.’ The police claimed it was in self-defense.\\n\\n> A Los Angeles Police Department plainclothes officer, Carlton Olson, picked up a female prostitute. Olson then joined other officers and ordered Turner out of the car. According to the L.A.P.D., Turner proclaimed, “Oh God, I can’t go to jail!” and shot at officers with a .22 caliber pistol concealed at [her] waist. One officer returned fire, hitting Turner in the chest.\\n> \\n> Witnesses tell another story. They saw Turner, who they identified as a woman, running away from police, not returning fire. Witnesses even reported that Turner was handcuffed by police after [she] was shot.\\n> \\n> According to an article by Angela Douglas in Come Out! Magazine shortly after their deaths, Laverne (Larry) Turner and Ginny Gallegos were both killed for resisting arrest and in Laverne’s case for being dressed in “feminine attire.”\\n\\nLaverne had been in service with the U.S. Navy but had been discharged because she had an antipathy towards weapons.\\n\\nhttp://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/the-politics-of-gender-self-determination-more-interviews-with-captive-genders-contributors/\\n\\nhttp://erikasuderburg.com/id28.html\\n\\nhttps://www.lib.umn.edu/pdf/tretter/TretterLetterJune2011.pdf\\n\\nhttp://students673.ucr.edu/docsserver/lgbt/trans_remembrance_display_posters.pdf\\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_JeZ7LEIRhvewTCoL5mVkH6MQJzf7fSXl4-P6QJ0v0/edit#gid=0   \n",

Three teenagers were convicted of the crime, but freed on appeal.\\n\\n> Maxwell was found dead in his house on Doggett Road on April 22nd 1972. He was 26-years old, of dual heritage and gay. He often crossed-dressed and was also known as Michelle.\\n> \\n> Maxwell was often seen drinking in The Black Bull and The Castle pubs in Lewisham.\\n\\nThe investigation into the murder led to a major review into how suspects are treated by the police, especially children and vulnerable people. A cause celebre, it came to be seen as a classic miscarriage of justice.\\n\\n> The Fire Brigade was called to 27 Doggett Road, Catford at 0121 hours on 22 April 1972. A body was found.  It was that of Maxwell Confait a 26 year old mixed race man from the Seychelles. A gay (?) transgender (?) prostitute, Confait preferred to be called Michelle and was well-known in the local area. He frequented the Black Bull Pub (now Fox and Firkin) and the Castle (now Bar Nuvo). He had been strangled. \\n> \\n> The police did not look very far. The first suspect was Winston Goode, the victim’s landlord and friend who lived at the same property with his wife Lillian and their children although the couple were separated. He denied any sexual relationship with Confait but admitted being jealous that Confait was planning to move out. Shortly afterwards he committed suicide by swallowing cyanide.\\n> \\n> On 24 April there were three more fires: along the railway line near Catford Bridge Station; a sports hut on Ladywell Fields and 1 Nelgarde Road (the next street).The police arrested three youths. Colin Lattimore aged eighteen but with learning disabilities, Ronnie Leighton, aged 15 and Ahmet Salih aged 14. The three were questioned without another adult present. Lattimore admitted to the murder but Salih confessed only to observing it.\\n> \\n> The case went to trial at the Old Bailey where it received national media coverage. Despite the boys all having alibis for the time of death and claiming that the police had been violent to them in custody, Lattimore was found guilty of manslaughter, detained indefinitely, and sent to Rampton Hospital.\\nLeighton and Salih were found guilty of arson at Doggett Road and Ladywell Fields. Leighton was sent to Aylesbury Prison for life. Salih was sent to Royal Philanthropic School, Redhill for four years due to his age.\\n> \\n> In July 1973, leave to appeal was refused despite disagreement between experts over the time of death. In 1975, the Home Secretary Roy Jenkins referred the case to the Court of Appeal. Following a high-level campaign led by Christopher Price, then local MP for Lewisham East, all three suspects were later found not guilty and freed by the Appeal Court. Lord Scarman criticised the original investigation for not emphasising the fact that there had been no struggle. This suggested that the victim knew his killer. He declared all three “innocent”. The Home Secretary then ordered a full enquiry by Sir Henry Fisher to look at the Judges Rules (i.e. how the police treat suspects, especially children and vulnerable people. Fisher made recommendations for reform but disagreed with Scarman finding two of the three defendants ” guilty on the balance of probability”.  As a result, the report had to be published as a “return to the House of Commons” to make it exempt from libel. A Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure followed.\\n\\n> In 1972, a man called Maxwell Confait was murdered. Two children and a man with an intellectual disability were arrested and, based on their confessions, convicted. Several years later, forensic evidence showed that they were innocent. Their confessions had been false and were the combined result of their vulnerability and their treatment by police during detention and questioning.\\n> \\n> Public concern over the Maxwell Confait case in 1972 led Parliament, via a public inquiry and then a Royal Commission, to pass the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and its Codes of Practice (PACE).  \\n> \\n> PACE set out the rules and safeguards for policing in England and Wales including role of the appropriate adult (AA). The principal intention was to reduce the risk of miscarriages of justice as a result of evidence being obtained from vulnerable suspects which, by virtue of their vulnerability, led to unsafe and unjust convictions\\n\\nMaxwell/Michelle Confit’s murder remains unsolved.\\n\\nRadical Deviance, May 1997\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Maxwell_Confait\\n\\nhttp://gaynewsarchive.org/tag/maxwell-confait/\\n\\nhttps://lewishamheritage.blogspot.com/2018/08/the-maxwell-confait-murder.html\\n\\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1095508.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\\n\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-an-inquiry-into-the-death-of-maxwell-confait\\n\\nhttps://www.appropriateadult.org.uk/index.php/information/development/need/fair-justice/history\\n\\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190219220503/https://www.catfordcentral.com/do-you-remember-maxwell-confait-michelle/\\n\\nhttp://students673.ucr.edu/docsserver/lgbt/trans_remembrance_display_posters.pdf\\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10_JeZ7LEIRhvewTCoL5mVkH6MQJzf7fSXl4-P6QJ0v0/edit#gid=0   \n",

       "4028  Alejandra was a professional makeup artist. Her body was found in a hotel gagged and with stab wounds after she had arranged to meet a man there. He is being sought by police.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Puebla.- A virus for which there seems to be no vaccine in Puebla is that of homophobia, which has later claimed one more victim, Alejandra Zaya, a transsexual woman who was found lifeless and with signs of having been stabbed in a hotel in the middle of Historic Center of Angelopolis. \\r\\n> \\r\\n> According to reports, Zayas was a professional makeup artist who worked mainly in Mexico City, although she was originally from Misantla, in Veracruz, but who was in the capital of Puebla to have a meeting with a man she met on a social network. \\r\\n> \\r\\n>  The Puebla State Prosecutor's Office has begun an investigation into the murder of which the main suspect is a man whose whereabouts are unknown for now, but who was identified by a relative of the victim. \\r\\n> \\r\\n> According to accounts, Zayas was found by her cousin in the Hotel Isabel on Calle 5 poniente in a pool of blood as a result of several stab wounds which she had received to the abdomen from a broken glass. \\r\\n\\r\\nAle lived in Mexico City, where she worked for MAC Cosmetics. She was originally from Misantla, in the state of Veracruz. Her Facebook profile is https://www.facebook.com/alejandroo.zl.\\r\\n\\r\\n> \"I have never liked to victimize myself, but suffering homophobia is the worst thing that can happen to someone as a person; but just those details make you stronger. Do not let it\"  -- Ale Zayas, 17th May 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\n[**#JusticiaParaAleZayas**](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/justiciaparaalezayas)

She had been stabbed in the abdomen and had been dead around 48 hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victim was of Colombian origin. Her identity was not made public.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Early yesterday morning yesterday the authorities were notified about the discovery of a body next to a shopping center located in Costa del Silencio, within the municipality of Arona. Everything indicates that the death occurred at least two days before.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> The scene that the specialists of the Civil Guard displaced in the vicinity of said shopping center, called El Chaparral, had to witness, was not pleasant for anyone.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> On the ground was the lifeless body of a transsexual woman whose identity has only transcended that information, but nothing about her parentage or origin. Not only had at least 48 hours passed since the death had occurred, but the cause of death was obvious, although the last word in this regard always depends on the final results of the tests that make up an autopsy.\\r\\n> \\r\\n> The corpse had wounds in the abdominal area compatible with an attack carried out with a knife. The number of possible stab wounds will be one of the unknowns revealed by forensic specialists from the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Institute of Legal Medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\nA suspect was arrested several hours after the discovery of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2020/12/arrestado-en-arona-tras-la-violenta-muerte-de-una-mujer/\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://andaluciainformacion.es/andalucia/940799/detenido-por-la-muerte-de-un-hombre-en-arona-tenerife/\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.cuerpospoliciales.com/index.php/2020/12/27/hallan-a-un-joven-en-avanzado-estado-de-descomposicion-en-costa-del-silencio/\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.eldia.es/sucesos/2020/12/27/hallan-joven-avanzado-descomposicion-costa-26765421.html\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.laprovincia.es/sucesos/2020/12/26/hallan-cadaver-signos-violencia-tenerife-26751380.html   \n",
